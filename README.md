# Ripley-s-K-funtion
Estimates de value of the linearized version of the Ripley's K-funtion (Ripley, 1977), as proporsed by Bessag (1977), for a group of points in a cartesian plane. Also, will test the significance of the L-value (if the points pattern is aggregated, random or regular), by Monte Carlo simulations.
